Hi there! This is Shyam, the one whose fingers bled the words you are reading. I welcome you to this side of the internet. 

I am crruntly working as a associte structural engineer at (McDermott.com)[https://www.mcdermott.com/]. My profile says _structural engineer_,but I am a coder from the heart and the brain. I am from Rajasthan but currently living in Chennai. 

My interests by the day are programming, physics, and problem-solving and by the night are philosophy, poetry and podcasts. (Aslo books, music, languages, gym, guitar and much more stuff that doesn't go with the alliteration. My hobbies are reading, writing, listening to music, running (hardly anymore), and practicing language on duolingo.
