I spend the whole weekend on designing and tweaking this website. A huge shoutout to `chatGPT` for helping me in this task. I couldn't have done it withtout it. 

I am switching to the newsletter format to document my life online. It is different from the _posts_ format in the presentation because it doesn't have all the informative stuff. The basic format is the same which is given in this newsletter. The first newsletter will be released next sunday. 

## Qotue of the week
>“The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts.”
> 
> ― Marcus Aurelius, Meditations

## Book of the week
The book I am currently reading is: __The Greatest Show on Eearth: Evidence for Evolution__ by Richard Dawkins. It is rich in informatoin and has an explanatory style unique to Dawkins. He pulls out examples from various fields and anacdotes from his personal experience to make the book even more interesting than the title suggests. I am halfway through the book and hope to finish it by the weekend.

## Song of the week

I am currently obssessed with _Clorine_ by _twenty one pilots_. It has one a preety catchy attention seeking beat in the background which continues to play in my head all day and I am forced to listen to it again. The band has nailed the music to this song.

## Movie of the week
Recently I have finished the websries Marvel's __Hit Monkey__. I watched the first season in 2022 when I was living alone in Delhi. When I went to hotstar after a long time I saw that the new season is out. I immidiately jumped to it. The first season was promising but this one has got even more brutal, the story is intense and rich with characters.

## Youtube video of the week

Most of us have been guided to speak in English. Through our teachers, through some friends, and through various other channels. But what is the guide itself doesn't know English. For example, there is no English teacher in your school and PT teacher is teaching you English. In his latest video, Rob talks us through such a guide book published in 1885: `English As She is Spoke`. Don't miss the hilarious commentory on the hilarious book.
