_I would have nailed this one if and only if I had a good camera._

I spend the whole weekend on designing and tweaking this website. A huge shout-out to `chatGPT` for helping me in this task. I couldn't have done it without it; maybe I could have but it would have been a hell harder than this. I have also realized that as I use this feature more and more I am getting better and better at writing better prompts. Now I write a detailed prompts in my notepad and in one prompt ChatGPT gives exactly what I want from it. Sometimes, some miner manual debugging but that's mostly it.

A huge shout-out to GitHub community member [Soumya Kundu](https://weiqi.soumyak4.in/) for his valuable contribution and suggestion in configuring the theme. I wanted to buy him a coffee but currently I am broke; maybe next month (maybe!). Also thank you for your suggestion [Hayanu Shi](https://huanyushi.github.io/). All of you make my life much better. 

I have also decided to merge The Rest Frame with this website. The Rest Frame has been my blog for last five years. It has grown in my arms. It's sad to let it go, but TRF is not a separate identity from Shyam. They both are one. Like Tony Stark and Iron-man.  But more of that later, Maybe in next newsletter when I have fully configured this website. Maybe never. 

I have also decided to quit all forms of social media (except WhatsApp and email). So if you have any concerns and suggestion, please ping me an email at [shyam10kwd@gmail.com](mailto:shyam10kwd@gmail.com). This newsletter will be only medium to express my life. So check is regularly. 

I am switching to the newsletter format to document my life online. It is different from the _posts_ format in the presentation because it doesn't have all the informative stuff. The basic format is the same which is given in this newsletter. The first newsletter will be released next Sunday.

## Book of the week
The book I am currently reading is: __The Greatest Show on Earth: Evidence for Evolution__ by Richard Dawkins. It is rich in information and has an explanatory style unique to Dawkins. He pulls out examples from various fields and anecdotes from his personal experience to make the book even more interesting than the title suggests. I am halfway through the book and hope to finish it by the weekend. Maybe I will write a review of this book and post on this blog, maybe not. Who cares.

## Song of the week

I am currently obsessed with _Chlorine_ by _twenty one pilots_. It has one a pretty catchy attention seeking beat in the background which continues to play in my head all day and I am forced to listen to it again. There are many other songs which I am currently playing on loop but this one surely tops the list. Maybe I should make a separate page to store all these fields. Maybe I will, maybe I won't. But Enjoy this song directly from here (it's embedded.)

## Movie of the week
Recently I have finished the web-series Marvel's __Hit Monkey: Season 2__. I watched the first season in 2022 when I was living alone in Delhi. When I went to Hotstar after a long time I saw that the new season is out. I immediately jumped to it. The first season was promising but this one has got even more brutal, the story is intense and rich with characters.

## Article of the week

Here is a cool article for you. It is written on the exploration of the concept of _intuition_ throughout the history of philosophy. 
[What Is Intuition & Can You Trust It?](https://www.thecollector.com/what-is-intuition-can-trust-it/)

## YouTube video of the week

Most of us have been guided to speak English through our teachers, through some friends, and through various other channels. But what if the guide itself doesn't know English? For example, there is no English teacher in your school and PT teacher is teaching you English. In his latest video, Rob talks us through such a guide book published in 1885: `English As She is Spoke`. Don't miss the hilarious commentary on the hilarious book.

## Yeah so that's it I guess 

This is just an example of what I dream of a newsletter to be. I will update big steps of my life here (also small steps). I will post every update of my life here (I will try my best to do so). I aspire to do many things, most of them don't succeed. But yeah that's it I guess. Wait for my next newsletter. Cheers Ciao.
