I know I haven't been updating my blog for quite a while now. My job has been busy and whatever free time I get, I waste it by scrolling reels or shorts.  I am not at my best self for quite some while now. So this post is about giving you some updates about my life. And also announcing my return to this blog. I hope I stick this time around. 

I am currently reading two books: Pride And Prejudice by Jane Austin and Behave by Robert Spolsky. One of them is cleverly written and very enjoyable book, while other is basically a fiction book to read when non-fiction becomes overwhelming. I am just kidding, I can't insult classic book like that! I am enjoying both of them very much. 

I am watching `How I Met Your Mother`. You can already guess my favorite character: it's Ted. He is just like me, hopeless romantic, desperate and doing all sorts of things to find the love of his life. Well I am also writing this post, don't look at me with narrow eyes. 

Ah, I have been doing a lot of coding lately. I am learning `go` programming language. It's a very beautiful and simplistic language developed by `goGGLE` (get it?). I am addicted to learning thanks to [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/dashboard)'s excellent curriculum. Here are some of my latest project for you to explore:

- Pokedox: github.com/iashyam/pokedox
- Gator: github.com/iashyam/gator
You can explore them. Give me some feedback, it would be actually nice. 

I have quit gym. (Oh my god Shyam! Why?)  I haven't quit it, my subscription has expired. Can you believe it? I actually went to the gym the whole of my one year tenure. Yes. Now that I will get  my salary, I am renewing my subscription the first thing of the month. 

I have started cooking myself. (For nth time, Are you going to stick this time?) I know it's hard. But I am starting to enjoy it. I cook lunch, breakfast and dinner for myself. It's been a week and I haven't order food yet. That's actually great. I still need to learn a lot of things, but I will get on it. (I hope I will.)

What else?

I took my laptop to my office. Yes! And ever since I did that, I don't want to leave my seat. I only wonder why didn't I do this earlier, when I have wasted literally two years of my life. I could have been expert on go programming language by now. But let's not regret past decision and move on to the future. 

This is time of year when you look back and reflect what you achieved and missed. Maybe I will do that in next post. Maybe I won't. Oh the Spotify wrapped is coming up. (Youtube music recap for me). Maybe I will explain my music taste and how I came out it. Maybe I won't (it's so girly nowadays, you will think I am teenage girl it I explain that. )

Until then, take care bye!
