<br>
<br>
<br>
He was walking alone, barefoot<br>
On a road in a desert.<br>
His beard was grown white<br>
Long white hairs, scattered.<br>
<br>
He had achieved the eternity<br>
Gone beyond event horizon, to the singularity<br>
He had achieved self-integrity<br>
And now he was happy in Brownian motion.<br>
<br>
He had seen the watcher, met the mighty<br>
Now he could talk with the emotions,<br>
He excelled at area of all relations<br>
And the variables of all the motions.<br>
He had used his brain hundred percent,<br>
He knows what happens during measurement,<br>
He was so powerful; he was so confident.<br>
He learned to suppress the need and greed<br>
Now he was going to lead humanity.<br>
<br>
Then he entered a village,<br>
The one who bowed was blessed<br>
Also, those who didn’t was blessed.<br>
He was singing a song of Sartaaj<br>
The king of all Maharajas<br>
And in a loud loud awaj.<br>
He wanted to reach all the society.<br>
Then he felt thirsty<br>
His throat was facing drought<br>
And he was in a fight with himself,<br>
His sight was fading and he walked<br>
With a speed close to light<br>
And he reached a well.<br>
<br>
A woman was taking out water there,<br>
He requested her some water,<br>
She gave him a bowl of water<br>
But that didn’t quench his thirst.<br>
He took the pot and made it dry<br>
But that didn’t make him satisfied<br>
He was confused feeling dry,<br>
His hands were shaking<br>
He was feeling weak and the next moment<br>
He jumped in the well.<br>
He was not afraid of death but still feeling thirsty.<br>
He woke up with his heart beating fast<br>
<br>
Because his conscious mind didn’t know<br>
What is there after death.<br>
He was in his room only,<br>
He walked to the pot of water<br>
And drink some di-hydrogen mono oxide.<br>
Now his thirst was satisfied.<br>
Later in the afternoon,<br>
He was teaching his class<br>
The lesson of harsh actuality<br>
No matter how good the life is in your dream<br>
You would have to wake up and face reality.<br>
Your deeds will define you<br>
Your plans don’t matter<br>
If you want to quench your thirst,<br>
You need to wake up and walk to the water.<br>
<br>
<br>
This poem is a sincere experience, It is based on a true event. I was thirsty in my dream and when I woke up, I found out that I was thirsty in real life too. <br>
<br>
I moved to Delhi this Monday, it is not good here. I am missing my family too much. Also,, I have started to play cricket again. Yesterday, I went to the ground for the first time <a href="https://www.iashyam.in/2021/03/way-after-year-midsem-returns.html">since I left Delhi</a>, I didn't get many overs to play because there are many new lads in the team but yeah It was nice to have some energy and be in the field. But one thing was strange, even I was playing after a long time, I didn't get out on Zero(hhehe). Actually, I didn't get out, In two out of three matches I remained not out and in the last match, I got run out. Pretty impressive. I also bowled one over and got a wicket as well. It was caught and bowled, I didn't go for it honestly, It just stuck in my left hand and when I caught my breath up my friends were hugging me and congratulating me to get the dangerous man out. But now my body is aching a lot. <br>
<br>
Thank You everyone for this support you have shown to my blog. I am very happy seeing it and also for those who are new here... I post a poem or story every Thursday so don't forget to check it every Friday/</p>
