## Introduction 
Since the dawn of AI through Chatbots like ChatGPT there has been a lot of debates around the AI-ethics. There are many problems that I so relate with, for example ethical gathering of training data for LLMs. I will discuss these problems in a separate and more detailed article. But for now, I am going to focus on the problems which are hyped too much and counts to nothing. These problems are highlighted by you-know-who just with an agenda of slowing down the progress. These are purely philosophical questions, and these don't require the knowledge of transformers to deal. But here is a problem: I am not a philosopher. So, heads up, this might look like bullshit if you are into philosophy.
