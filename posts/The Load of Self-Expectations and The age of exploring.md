Five months have gone by and I haven't finished a book in 2025 yet. All the goals I had set at the beginning of the year lay shattered, and I am not even at the sight of finishing them anywhere. I didn't have to start anything to achieve all the those goal because I was already on the way. Let me list my goals to start with 

- Learn Machine learning and AI
- To get into shape, gain weight. 
- Learn some fashion, skin care and stuff. 
- To read books about 25 of them. 
- Maintain this blog. 

I didn't have to start anything. I was learning Machine Learning, i was actively coding. I was going to gym, I was following a good skin care routine. I was reading books just fine. I was gaining weight. I just needed to continue doing. But I failed to do so. 

But I failed to do so. I discontinued everything from the beginning. I stopped learning AI for the nth time. I got some weight but it's mostly belly fat because I didn't follow the diet I was following before. All I did to learn fashion was to buy five new T-Shirts last month. I did finish Anna Karenina which I was reading at the time, but I started another Russian Classic- The idiot. That's the only book I have finished in 2025, but I didn't finish a book that I started in 2025. All of my goals have failed. 

Most of the goals, which are not attached to each other, fell in a similar manner. The main reason was just that I was lazy.
